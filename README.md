Numerical simulations of spin dynamics 

## Synposis
SpinNumerica is a project in development. Its main purpose is to provide a simple and efficient environment for
computation of spin dynamics problems. The user interface is designed to be as close as possible to Malcolm Levitt's 
SpinDynamica package. SpinDynamica is based on Mathematica, and allows both symbolic and numerical computations.
SpinNumerica tries to emulate the SpinDynamica user interface as far as possible, such that SpinDynamica users should
be immediately familiar it.

To this effect, it uses the same naming conventions and parameter orders as SpinDynamica wherever possible.

Of course, many of the capabilities of SpinDynamica cannot be replicated in a purely numerical environment. Therefore, SpinNumerica
will always only implement a subset of capabilities.
